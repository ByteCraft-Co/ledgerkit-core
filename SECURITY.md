# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
LedgerKit Core is in early development.

Only the **latest released version** is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security issue, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by:
- Emailing: bytecraft.co1@gmail.com
- Or using GitHub’s private security advisory feature (if available)

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact

Reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis.

## Scope
LedgerKit Core is a domain framework and does **not** include:
- Network services
- Authentication systems
- Cryptographic protocols
- Database engines

Security reports should focus on logic flaws, data handling, or serialization
within the library itself.

Reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis.  
Fixing or responding to a reported issue may take some time, but efforts will be
made to investigate and resolve valid reports when possible.
